# srconfigs

A simple-to-use set of configuration files for speedrunning Portal 2 and its mods with SAR.

## Installation

Place all these config files within the `Portal 2/portal2/cfg` directory, as is;
they should automatically be run by the game as necessary. Ensure [SAR] is
installed. Refer to the [Speedrun Setup Guide] for a video tutorial.

## Categories

These configuration files support the following speedrun categories:

- Inbounds No SLA (`fullgame`)
- Any% (`anypc`)
- Singleplayer Challenge Mode (`sp_cm`)
- All Main Courses (`amc`)
- All Courses (`ac`)
- Solo Coop (`solocoop`)
- Coop Challenge Mode (`coop_cm`)
- Chapter ILs (`chapter_il`)
- Individual Levels (`il`)
- Celeste Mode (`celeste` - P2SM only)
- Reverse Mod (`reverse` - P2SM only)
- Workshop Maps (`workshop`)
- Bhop Maps (`bhop`)

To manually switch to a category, simply run the category name as a
command; for instance, the command `anypc` activates the Any% category.

The configs will try to automatically detect the right
category when you load into a map. Note that singleplayer Any%,
coop All Courses, and Solo Coop cannot be detected; if you are running these
categories, you must manually switch to them.

After manually selecting a category, the automatic selection will not be
re-enabled until the `auto` command is ran.

Note that in mods, only the `fullgame` category exists from the above.

An `il` category is also added for individual workshop maps as well as
manually-downloaded chambers, while `workshop` should be used for multiple
workshop maps (MRCC). The `bhop` category specifically times maps that include
the Timer prefab often seen on bhop maps.

## Binds

You *must* set the following binds for the configs to function
correctly:

- `bind mwheelup +scrollup`
- `bind mwheeldown +scrolldown`

When used in Portal Reloaded, the commands to shoot portals are `+att1`, `+att2`, and `+att3`. Therefore you should set these binds:

- `bind mouse1 +att1; bind mouse2 +att2; bind mouse3 +att3`

It is recommended to change your chat bind (`say`) to the more general `chat` provided by srconfigs.

- `bind <key> chat`

You can bind the following commands:

- `dialogue_toggle` - toggle the dialogue from glados, wheatley, and the announcer
- `funneling_toggle` - toggle portal funneling
- `fullbright_toggle` - toggle fullbright
- `customsens_toggle <sensitivity>` - toggle custom sensitivity
- `useswap_toggle` - toggle scrollup being use
- `supershoot_toggle` - toggle scroll being shoot
- `30fps_toggle` - toggle 30fps mode (for coop button glitches and certain SLA tricks)
- `contimes_toggle` - toggle seeing contimes text (e.g. for double dialogue skip)
- `slowwalk_toggle <speed>` - toggle walking speed
- `toggleduck` - toggle being crouched
- `togglesprint` - (for INFRA) toggle sprinting
- `swapsplit` - switch between the blue and orange robots when playing solocoop
- `do_load <save name>` - load a save only if in non-CM singleplayer. (Deprecated - see `cm_only` and `non_cm_only` below)
- `do_reset` - reset your run
- `viewsnap_next` - go to the next viewsnap setting. Refer to `viewsnap.cfg` for routes.
- `reset_sens` - resets sensitivity after doing viewsnaps.

All of the `_toggle` binds also have `+`/`-` versions; e.g.
`+supershoot` can be bound to enable supershoot only while a key is
held.

The aliases `cm_only`, `non_cm_only`, `cat_only`, and `non_cat_only`
can be used to make a bind only effective in certain cases, e.g.
`bind r "cm_only do_reset; cat_only amc stopvideos"`

## HUD text

Every toggle has a piece of associated HUD text which can be shown or
hidden at will.

The text visibility can be changed using `sar_hud_show_text` and
`sar_hud_hide_text`; for instance, `sar_hud_show_text 2` will show the
text corresponding to fullbright. The text IDs are below.

- 0: dialogue
- 1: funneling
- 2: fullbright
- 3: customsens
- 4: useswap
- 5: supershoot
- 6: 30fps
- 7: contimes
- 8: slowwalk

## Customisation svars

You can customise the behaviour of srconfigs by setting the following
svars using the `svar_set` command.

For instance, `svar_set no_dialogue_toasts 1` will disable dialogue fade toasts.

## Chapter ILs

Chapter ILs have an extra command you should use in order to set which
chapter you're running.

The command `run_cur_chapter` will set up chapter ILs to run the chapter
for the map you're currently in; or alternatively, you can use the command
`run_chapter 5` (for instance) to set it up to run chapter 5.

This will automatically force the `chapter_il` category (so you should use
`auto` to later switch to other categories). Once you've set the chapter
to run, you can use your reset bind etc as normal.

## CM Autoreset

Included in srconfigs is a feature that automatically resets CM
([Challenge Mode]) runs if you don't reach splits by certain times.

To use this functionality, make a folder in the uppercase Portal 2
directory called `autoreset`. In this folder, make a file called
`<map>.txt` where `<map>` is what you get from `svar_get map` while on
the map, e.g. `portal-gun.txt`.

Then, on each line in this file you can add the tick number at
which the run should be reset. For example, with the following
`portal-gun.txt`:

```txt
316
686
1098
1930
1930
2004
```

The run would be automatically reset if you didn't reach the Door Trigger
in 5.267 seconds (316 ticks), the Drop Trigger in 11.433 seconds
(686 ticks), etc.

The `sar_speedrun_result` command will output these tick values at the
end of each split line.

If a certain split doesn't matter, you can set its cutoff time to that
of the next split, as shown above on the fourth split.

[Challenge Mode]: https://wiki.portal2.sr/Challenge_Mode

## Extra configuration

Rather than modifying this autoexec.cfg directly, it is *highly
recommended* you put any "personal" configuration (e.g. setting svars,
performing HUD customisation) in `extra.cfg`. This file will be run
once by the autoexec. This file should be used in order to make updating
this set of config files easier; as long as the autoexec is never
modified, updates should be a simple drag-and-drop process.

In this file you can define extra categories if you wish, using the
`add_cat` and `detect_cat` commands. For instance, to add a category
named "tournament" and automatically switch to it when on a specific
map, simply add this to `extra.cfg`:

```cfg
add_cat tournament
detect_cat tournament "map=workshop/123456/map_name"
```

When this category is activated, as well as every map load in which it
is enabled, the file `cats/tournament.cfg` will be `exec`d; this file
should therefore contain the necessary configuration for the category.
Look at the built-in category files for an example.
